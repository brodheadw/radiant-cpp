# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Radiant
project.

## Reporting a Bug

The Radiant team and community take all security bugs very seriously. We
appreciate efforts for responsible disclosure and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainers at johnny.shaw@live.com.

The Radiant team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After
the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you
informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the Raditn team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary developer. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
* Seek review from respected third-party security experts.
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
  released as fast as possible.
